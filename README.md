# Code Projects
This will be the repository where I stored all the code I'm doing as I learn both Python and web development. The goal of this repository is to help me and other friends 
to spot our mistakes and to review the code we used to write. To improve ourselves with time, the goal is to get back to this repository after some time to
**improve your code**.
